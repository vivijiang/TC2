Project Overview

The goal of this challenge is to incrementally create HTML5 Prototype based on provided storyboards for Topcoder Web Arena using HTML5 and CSS3.

NOTE: This application is using regular HTML5 + Bootstrap 3 (http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started). Please follow coding standards. No AngularJS!

Competition Task Overview

The main task of this competition is to implement all pages in the provided prototype. Your prototype must work properly in all the required browsers.

We can reuse the code arena of Topcoder Web Arena UI.

We have provided normal design and mobile design. Please provide prototype for desktop browser and mobile browser.

Key Requirements

Test in all the required browsers.
Watch word typos in every place including source code. Make sure they have correct meaning.
Use CSS3 for whenever required.
Your code or HTML layout should be Responsive ready.
For any popup/modal you code, make it close if you click on x icon or if you click outside the popup/modal.
Make sure the page rendered properly different screen resolutions.

Specific HTML/CSS/JavaScript Requirements

Your HTML code must be valid HTML5 and follow best practices
Validate your code - reviewers may accept minor validation errors, but please comment your reason for any validation errors. Use the validators listed in the scorecard.
Use CSS to space out objects, not clear/transparent images (GIFs or PNGs) and use proper structural CSS to layout your page. Only use table tags for tables of data/information and not for page layout.

Provide comments on the page elements to give clear explanation of code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.
Please use clean INDENTATION for all HTML code so future developers can follow the code.
All HTML code naming should not have any conflicts
Make sure all HTML files pass Validation without Error/Warning.
2. CSS3

Provide comments on the CSS code, we need CSS comments to give clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.

Payments

TopCoder will compensate members in accordance with the payment structure of this challenge. Initial payment for the winning member will be distributed in two installments. The first payment will be made at the closure of the approval phase. The second payment will be made at the completion of the support period.

Reliability Rating and Bonus

For challenges that have a reliability bonus, the bonus depends on the reliability rating at the moment of registration for that project. A participant with no previous projects is considered to have no reliability rating, and therefore gets no bonus. Reliability bonus does not apply to Digital Run winnings. Since reliability rating is based on the past 15 projects, it can only have 15 discrete values.
